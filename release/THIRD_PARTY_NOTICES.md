# ClassInEDBMVP third-party notices

This notice index applies to the versions recorded in
`dependency-inventory.json` and the build-generated SPDX SBOM. The packaged
`release_metadata/license-files/` directory contains the license texts shipped
by each exact installed Python distribution. Absence of a component from this
summary does not override its copied license text.

## Review-required components

- **PyMuPDF 1.27.2.3** declares dual licensing under GNU AGPL v3 or an Artifex
  commercial license. Public distribution requires a release-specific legal or
  commercial-license approval.
- **pyhwp 0.1b15** declares GNU AGPL v3-or-later. Public distribution requires
  a documented compliance decision, including corresponding-source scope.
- **Upscayl**, only when explicitly bundled, is separately gated by
  `resources/upscayl/LICENSE`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and
  `CORRESPONDING_SOURCE.txt` for the exact binary and models.

## Python dependencies

The complete inventory and exact versions are machine-readable. Their license
files are copied from installed wheel metadata during every release build and
covered by a SHA-256 manifest. This includes Pillow, NumPy, OpenCV, olefile,
HWP/HWPX helpers, cryptography, lxml, Pydantic, PyInstaller and its build-time
dependencies. PyInstaller's bundled bootloader is governed by its documented
exception in the copied PyInstaller license file.

This file is a technical notice bundle, not legal advice or a declaration that
all redistribution obligations have been satisfied.
